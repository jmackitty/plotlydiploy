# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview of Project:

The purpose of this project is to study bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. A food start up is trying to find that perfect bacteria to tastes like beef, so this research would help them develop a meat substitute. Since the human body contains many different species, the belief is that the right bacteria that produces protein that tastes like beef may be found on the human navel. To study this theory samples of navels of volunteers were taken to see what bacterial species are present in the volunteers. 

## Analysis: 

The analysis will focus on creating a dashboard that visualizes the bacterial data for both research participants and fellow researchers to access. When the start up discovers the bacteria that produces the beef-like protein, the volunteers will be able to go on the dashboard to see if they have that bacteria in their navels.

## Results:

We were able to create an interactive dashboard so volunteers will be able to view the results of their belly button bacteria. The can select their ID in the dropdown menu and view their results. The volunteer can see a horizontal bar graph, a bubble chart, and a gauge chart, which all provide visualizations for the volunteer to view and interact with.
